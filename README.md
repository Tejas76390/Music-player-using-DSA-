# Music-player-using-DSA-

This project, developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, is a C++ based Basic Music Player. It employs a doubly linked list to manage the playlist, allowing efficient navigation and manipulation of songs. Stacks are used to implement undo and redo functionalities, enabling users to reverse or reapply actions easily. Queues manage the song playback order, ensuring smooth transitions between songs. Additionally, file handling techniques are integrated to read from and write to song files, providing persistent storage for the playlist. This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures to create a functional and user-friendly music player.
